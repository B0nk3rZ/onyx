# Getting Started with Project Onyx

## What is Project Onyx?

Project Oynx is a single page web application that interfaces with the Volcano Hybrid. The way the official web application works was not working for me so I made my own. After an initial POC I was enjoying the project and wanted to code something I'd be proud of :D

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
