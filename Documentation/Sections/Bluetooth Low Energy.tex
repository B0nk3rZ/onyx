\section{Known Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The characteristics for reading temperatures and receiving temperature updates all round to the nearest $^\circ C$
        \subitem This means we cannot fully support all temperatures in $\circ F$
    \item A successful write update to the Volcano's screen brightness sometimes results in the Volcano not updating its brightness
    \item The Volcano sometimes doesn't free up its Bluetooth connection. This can be fixed by power cycling the Volcano's Bluetooth by holding down the ``-'' button and the ``AIR'' button at the same time.
\end{itemize}
